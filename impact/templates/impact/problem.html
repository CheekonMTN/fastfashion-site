            and chemicals. Below you'll find headline statistics drawn from public reports, plus

                <strong>How this estimate is calculated:</strong>
                Researchers estimate that the global fashion and textile industry uses roughly
                {{ annual_water_liters|floatformat }} liters of water per year. We divide that 
                by the number of seconds in a year to estimate liters per second, then multiply 
                by the number of seconds passed since January 1st to produce a year-to-date value. 
                This simplified model illustrates scale — it is not a precise real-time measurement.

        <h2 class="subheading">Why fast fashion uses so much water</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Cotton farming is one of the most water-intensive agricultural systems in the world, 
            especially in dry regions where irrigation is required. On top of farming, dyeing, 
            bleaching, and finishing fabrics use millions of liters of water each day. As fashion 
            production accelerated in the 2000s, water use rose dramatically to keep up with demand.

        <h2 class="subheading">Explosion of synthetic fibers</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Today, around 69% of all global fiber production is synthetic — mainly polyester made 
            from fossil fuels. These fibers are cheap, versatile, and perfectly suited for fast 
            fashion’s rapid turnover model. However, synthetic production carries significant 
            environmental costs, including high energy use, carbon emissions, and long-lasting waste.

        <h2 class="subheading">Overproduction and short clothing lifespans</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            The fashion industry now produces more than 100 billion garments annually — more than 
            enough for every person on Earth to buy 12–14 items every year. Many of these pieces 
            are worn only a handful of times. About 60% of clothing is discarded within one year, 
            contributing to massive resource waste and landfill buildup.

        <h2 class="subheading">What happens to clothes after we throw them away?</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Around 87% of discarded textiles end up in landfills or incinerators. Only a small 
            portion is recycled, and most of that is downcycled into lower-quality materials like 
            insulation or industrial rags. Synthetic clothes can take decades to centuries to break 
            down, releasing microplastics and chemicals as they degrade.

        <h2 class="subheading">Microplastics from polyester</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Each load of laundry releases hundreds of thousands of tiny synthetic fibers into 
            waterways. These microplastics have been found in oceans, soil, food, drinking water, 
            and even human blood. Because polyester dominates the fast fashion market, microfiber 
            pollution is growing quickly and has become one of the biggest environmental concerns 
            connected to clothing.
