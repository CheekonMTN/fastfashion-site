                    Every year, the fashion industry produces over 100 billion garments,
                    relying heavily on water-intensive farming, fossil-fuel-based fibers,
                    and rapid production cycles that generate massive waste. This project
                    turns those impacts into clear, visual numbers so you can see what is
                    happening behind the clothes we buy.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Cotton farming is one of the most water-intensive agricultural systems in the world, 
                    especially in dry regions where irrigation is required. On top of farming, dyeing, 
                    bleaching, and finishing fabrics use millions of liters of water each day. As fashion 
                    production accelerated in the 2000s, water use rose dramatically to keep up with demand.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Today, around 69% of all global fiber production is synthetic — mainly polyester made 
                    from fossil fuels. These fibers are cheap, versatile, and perfectly suited for fast 
                    fashion’s rapid turnover model. However, synthetic production carries significant 
                    environmental costs, including high energy use, carbon emissions, and long-lasting waste.

                <p class="section-text">
                    The fashion industry now produces more than 100 billion garments annually — more than 
                    enough for every person on Earth to buy 12–14 items every year. Many of these pieces 
                    are worn only a handful of times. About 60% of clothing is discarded within one year, 
                    contributing to massive resource waste and landfill buildup.

                <p class="section-text">
                    Around 87% of discarded textiles end up in landfills or incinerators. Only a small 
                    portion is recycled, and most of that is downcycled into lower-quality materials like 
                    insulation or industrial rags. Synthetic clothes can take decades to centuries to break 
                    down, releasing microplastics and chemicals as they degrade.

                    Each load of laundry releases hundreds of thousands of tiny synthetic fibers into

                    and even human blood. Because polyester dominates the fast fashion market, microfiber 
                    pollution is growing quickly and has become one of the biggest environmental concerns
