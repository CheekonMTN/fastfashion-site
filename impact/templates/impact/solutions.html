            Individuals aren’t responsible for fixing the fashion system—but we can still take
            actions that matter. Here are realistic steps, plus a brief fairness and ethics check
            to keep things grounded.

            Sustainability often costs more. Not everyone can afford slow fashion, sustainable
            brands, or specialty materials. Any “solution” must respect budgets, needs, and access.
